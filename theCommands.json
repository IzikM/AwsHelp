      "issues before they're complete, even if the request already returned a",

      "times to ensure that the operation completes successfully. However, if",
      "the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the",

      "If you are looking for the low level S3 commands for the CLI, please",
      "see the \"s3api\" command reference page.",
      "Path Argument Type",
      "==================",
      "Whenever using a command, at least one path argument must be",
      "specified.  There are two types of path arguments: \"LocalPath\" and",
      "\"S3Uri\".",
      "\"LocalPath\": represents the path of a local file or directory.  It can",
      "be written as an absolute path or relative path.",
      "\"S3Uri\": represents the location of a S3 object, prefix, or bucket.",
      "This must be written in the form \"s3://mybucket/mykey\" where",
      "\"mybucket\" is the specified S3 bucket, \"mykey\" is the specified S3",
      "key.  The path argument must begin with \"s3://\" in order to denote",
      "that the path argument refers to a S3 object. Note that prefixes are",
      "separated by forward slashes. For example, if the S3 object \"myobject\"",
      "had the prefix \"myprefix\", the S3 key would be \"myprefix/myobject\",",
      "and if the object was in the bucket \"mybucket\", the \"S3Uri\" would be",
      "\"s3://mybucket/myprefix/myobject\".",
      "\"S3Uri\" also supports S3 access points. To specify an access point,",
      "this value must be of the form \"s3://<access-point-arn>/<key>\". For",
      "example if the access point \"myaccesspoint\" to be used has the ARN:",
      "\"arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint\" and the",
      "object being accessed has the key \"mykey\", then the \"S3URI\" used must",
      "be: \"s3://arn:aws:s3:us-",
      "west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey\". Similar to",
      "bucket names, you can also use prefixes with access point ARNs for the",
      "\"S3Uri\". For example: \"s3://arn:aws:s3:us-",
      "west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/myprefix/\"",
      "Order of Path Arguments",
      "=======================",
      "Every command takes one or two positional path arguments.  The first",
      "path argument represents the source, which is the local file/directory",
      "or S3 object/prefix/bucket that is being referenced.  If there is a",
      "second path argument, it represents the destination, which is the",
      "local file/directory or S3 object/prefix/bucket that is being operated",
      "on.  Commands with only one path argument do not have a destination",
      "because the operation is being performed only on the source.",
      "Single Local File and S3 Object Operations",
      "==========================================",
      "Some commands perform operations only on single files and S3 objects.",
      "The following commands are single file/object operations if no \"--",
      "recursive\" flag is provided.",
      "* \"cp\"",
      "* \"mv\"",
      "* \"rm\"",
      "For this type of operation, the first path argument, the source, must",
      "exist and be a local file or S3 object.  The second path argument, the",
      "destination, can be the name of a local file, local directory, S3",
      "object, S3 prefix, or S3 bucket.",
      "The destination is indicated as a local directory, S3 prefix, or S3",
      "bucket if it ends with a forward slash or back slash.  The use of",
      "slash depends on the path argument type.  If the path argument is a",
      "\"LocalPath\", the type of slash is the separator used by the operating",
      "system.  If the path is a \"S3Uri\", the forward slash must always be",
      "used.  If a slash is at the end of the destination, the destination",
      "file or object will adopt the name of the source file or object.",
      "Otherwise, if there is no slash at the end, the file or object will be",
      "saved under the name provided. See examples in \"cp\" and \"mv\" to",
      "illustrate this description.",
      "Directory and S3 Prefix Operations",
      "==================================",
      "Some commands only perform operations on the contents of a local",
      "directory or S3 prefix/bucket.  Adding or omitting a forward slash or",
      "back slash to the end of any path argument, depending on its type,",
      "does not affect the results of the operation.  The following commands",
      "will always result in a directory or S3 prefix/bucket operation:",
      "* \"sync\"",
      "* \"mb\"",
      "* \"rb\"",
      "* \"ls\"",
      "Use of Exclude and Include Filters",
      "==================================",
      "Currently, there is no support for the use of UNIX style wildcards in",
      "a command's path arguments.  However, most commands have \"--exclude",
      "\"<value>\"\" and \"--include \"<value>\"\" parameters that can achieve the",
      "desired result. These parameters perform pattern matching to either",
      "exclude or include a particular file or object.  The following pattern",
      "symbols are supported.",
      "* \"*\": Matches everything",
      "* \"?\": Matches any single character",
      "* \"[sequence]\": Matches any character in \"sequence\"",
      "* \"[!sequence]\": Matches any character not in \"sequence\"",
      "Any number of these parameters can be passed to a command.  You can do",
      "this by providing an \"--exclude\" or \"--include\" argument multiple",
      "times, e.g. \"--include \"*.txt\" --include \"*.png\"\". When there are",
      "multiple filters, the rule is the filters that appear later in the",
      "command take precedence over filters that appear earlier in the",
      "command. For example, if the filter parameters passed to the command",
      "were",
      "--exclude \"*\" --include \"*.txt\"",
      "All files will be excluded from the command except for files ending",
      "with \".txt\"  However, if the order of the filter parameters was",
      "changed to",
      "--include \"*.txt\" --exclude \"*\"",
      "All files will be excluded from the command.",
      "Each filter is evaluated against the **source directory**.  If the",
      "source location is a file instead of a directory, the directory",
      "containing the file is used as the source directory.  For example,",
      "suppose you had the following directory structure:",
      "/tmp/foo/",

      "examples to demonstrate this.",
      "Given the directory structure above and the command \"aws s3 cp",
      "/tmp/foo s3://bucket/ --recursive --exclude \".git/*\"\", the files",
